This view will display:

- the confirmation message for the commit result (the full commit text), its hash, and authorship
  information (authorâ€™s name, email, and commit date), or the error message if the commit failed.

- From here, there is no navigation available. The only thing we can do is press any key, which will
  trigger the application to close.
