A view that shows the logo flashing while the commit is being made.

I'm not sure if the commit should be done here or by sending a message on the bus, which would be
read in the main and executed in a Tokio spawn. I think it's better to do it in the main, and have
this view simply act as a "loading state," which could even be reused elsewhere.

This view has no interaction or navigation; it simply shows the logo flashing. It’s the router’s
responsibility to decide when to show this view and when to show the summary view, where the commit
result or error message is displayed.
