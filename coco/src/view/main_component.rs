/// There are three main children components:
/// - `Loading`: A component that will be displayed when the app is starting. This component
///   will be the first to be active and it will just show a loading message or spinner (or
///   nothing). It will be active until the git repo status is checked and the config files have
///   been read and loaded.
/// - `AppRouter`: The main section of the application, where we will be able to interact with
///   the app. This will route between the different main sections of the app and will shouw the
///   forms and info to be able to build our conventional commits.
/// - `Error`: A section that will be displayed when there's an irrecoverable error. Once
///   this section is active, the app will show the error and wait for the user to quit the app.
///   This is the only section that might never be active, but it's important to have it in the
///   flow of the app, so that the app can handle errors gracefully.
