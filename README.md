   # `coco` ‚Ä∫ [![LICENSE_BADGE][LICENSE_BADGE]][LICENSE_LINK] [![CRATE_BADGE][CRATE_BADGE]][CRATE_LINK] [![ISSUES_BADGE][ISSUES_BADGE]][ISSUES_LINK]

This is a port to Rust ‚ö° of the original (and slower)
[lucas-labs/coco-js](https://github.com/lucas-labs/coco-js), that was implemented using `node.js`.

This implementation, being written in Rust, is faster, more efficient and has implemented several
improvements over the original implementation.

## Installation

Pre-built binaries not available yet.

## Usage

Drop the `coco` binary somewhere in your `PATH` and run it in your repository:

```bash
$ coco

# and follow the steps üòä
```

## Configuration

`coco` can be configured by creating a `coco.yaml`, `coco.yml` or `.cocorc` file in your project's
root (per repository config) or in your users home directory (global config). The file should be a
valid YAML.

See the [`coco.yml`](https://github.com/lucas-labs/coco/blob/master/coco.yml) file from this
repository for an example configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Config is totally optional. If no config is provided, `coco` will use default values.

### Options
#### `types`
An array of commit types. Each type should be an object with the following properties: 
 * `name` - The name of the type
 * `desc` - The description of the type
 * `emoji` - The emoji to be used for the type if `useEmoji` is set to `true`

```yaml
types:
  - name: feat
    desc: A new feature
    emoji: üéâ
  - name: fix
    desc: A bug fix
    emoji: üêõ
```

#### `scopes`
An array of commit scopes. 

```yaml
scopes:
  - api
  - ui
```

If provided, instead of asking you to type the scope, `coco` will prompt you to select one from the
list.

#### `useEmoji`
Whether to use emojis in the summary. If set to `true`, the `emoji` property of the type will be
used to create the commit message. 

```yaml 
useEmoji: true
```
Provided `useEmoji` is `true`, an example of a commit message would be:
`feat(api): ‚ú® add new endpoint`

#### `askScope`
Whether to ask for the scope of the commit. IF set to `true`, the user will be prompted to enter or
select a scope (depending if scope list was provided by user config or not). If set to `false`, the
scope will be omitted from the commit message and the cli won't ask for it.

```yaml
askScope: true
```

#### `askBody`
Whether to ask for the body of the commit. If set to `true`, the user will be prompted to enter the
body of the commit. If set to `false`, the body will be omitted from the commit message and the cli
won't ask for it.

```yaml
askBody: true
```

#### `askFooter`
Whether to ask for the footer of the commit. If set to `true`, the user will be prompted to enter
the footer of the commit. If set to `false`, the footer will be omitted from the commit message and
the cli won't ask for it.

```yaml
askFooter: true
```

#### `askBreakingChange`
Whether to ask for the breaking change of the commit. If set to `true`, the user will be prompted to
specify if the commit is a breaking change. If set to `false`, the breaking change information will
be omitted from the commit message and the cli won't ask for it.

```yaml
askBreakingChange: true
```

#### `maxSummaryLength`
Defines the maximum length of the commit summary (the "title" of the commit). The summary textarea
will be limited to this length. 

The default value is `72`.

```yaml
maxSummaryLength: 72
```

#### `theme`

You can also customize the colors of the CLI by providing a `theme` object.
Check the [`coco.yml`](https://github.com/lucas-labs/coco/blob/master/coco.yml) file to a full list
of the available theme configuration tokens with their default values.

```yaml
theme:
  logo:fg:1: blue
  logo:fg:2: light-magenta
  ...
```

### Example
```yaml
# override the default commit types
types:
  - name: feat
    desc: A new feature
    emoji: üéâ
  - name: fix
    desc: A bug fix
    emoji: üêõ

# set of scopes to choose from
scopes:
   - api
   - ui

useEmoji: true # default
askScope: true # default
askBody: true # default
askFooter: true # default
askBreakingChange: true # default
```
